### Solidity Path: Beginner to Immediate Smart Contracts
  - [X] 1. **Making the Zombie Factory**
  - *Notes: A contract is the fundamental building block of Ethereum applications â€” all variables and functions belong to a contract. Use the correct version pragma (example: pragma solidity >=0.5.0 <0.6.0;). State variables are permanently stored in contract storage and written to the Ethereum blockchain. The "uint" data type is an unsigned integer, meaning its value must be non-negative. Structs allow you to create more complicated data types that have multiple properties. There are two types of arrays in Solidity: fixed arrays and dynamic arrays. Make your functions private by default. View functions view the data but don't modify it. Pure functions don't even access any data in the app. A hash function (example: keccak256) basically maps an input into a random 256-bit hexadecimal number. Events are a way for your contract to communicate that something happened on the blockchain to your app front-end.*
